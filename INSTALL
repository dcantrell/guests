OpenBSD qemu guest management tool

The 'guests' tool helps manage daemonized qemu guests.  It helps you install
them, manage their settings, and start them up either manually or at boot time.


Help:
    guests -h


Installation:

1) Choose a location for virt guests.  This directory will contain the disk
   images, guest configuration files, and the actual guests script.  You want
   this directory to be on a filesystem with plenty of available space.

       mkdir -p /var/guests

2) Create the directory tree:

       cd /var/guests
       mkdir guests.d           # individual guest configuration files go here
       mkdir install            # I use this to store install media (ISO files)

3) Install the core files:

       install -m 0755 guests /var/guests/guests
       install -m 0644 guests.conf /var/guests/guests.conf

4) Edit guests.conf to suit your system.


Usage:

All of these commands are executed from within /var/guests.

1) Start or stop all guests:

       ./guests start
       ./guests stop

2) List available guests:

       ./guests list

3) Start or stop a specific guest:

       ./guests start GUESTNAME
       ./guests stop GUESTNAME

4) Start or stop specific guests:

       ./guests start GUESTNAME1 GUESTNAME3
       ./guests stop GUESTNAME1 GUESTNAME3

5) Install a new guest (e.g., OpenBSD 4.9):

       curl -o install/OpenBSD-4.9-amd64.iso \
           http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.9/amd64/cd49.iso
       ./guests install \
           OpenBSD-4.9-amd64 \
           20G \
           install/OpenBSD-4.9-amd64.iso \
           x86_64
