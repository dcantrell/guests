HOST OPERATING SYSTEMS
======================

1) Edit guests.conf to your system.  By default, the host will have
   a tun10 network device created using 172.31.1.1 as the IP address.
   Guests will live on 172.31.1.0/24.  The default tunnel device is
   tun10 to avoid conflicts with software such as vpnc.  The default
   bridge device should be fine unless bridge0 is already in use on
   your system.

2) Add pf rules to NAT all guests through to your Internet connection.
   For my system, I have two Internet-capable interfaces.  I add these
   rules to pf.conf:

       # NAT for qemu guests
       pass out on iwn0 from 172.31.1.0/24 to any nat-to iwn0
       pass out on em0 from 172.31.1.0/24 to any nat-to em0

   This handles all use cases, regardless of which network interface I
   am actually using.  For laptops, this is really useful since you
   will change your network connection often.

   NOTE: You may have to disable pf if you take your laptop somewhere
   all network interfaces are down.  Even if you bring it back up, you
   will still hit browser issues that makes it look likr your network
   is hosed.  Simple solution after you bring up a connection:

       pfctl -d
       pfctl -e
       pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

GUEST OPERATING SYSTEMS
=======================

Fedora 14
    1) Boot with 'noapic' kernel option.
    2) After install, switch to tty2 and edit /mnt/sysimage/etc/grub.conf
           a) Make sure 'console=ttyS0' is on the kernel command line.
           b) Add 'terminal serial' to the main grub configuration.
    3) Make sure the eth* lines are removed from:
           /mnt/sysimage/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
       On boot up, a new rule will be added for eth0 with the correct MAC
       address.
    4) Edit /mnt/sysimage/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 for
       static networking.  Add:
           IPADDR=
           MACADDR=
           NETMASK=255.255.255.0
           BROADCAST=172.31.1.255
           DNS1=4.2.2.2
           DOMAIN=virt.burdell.org
    5) Edit /mnt/sysimage/etc/sysconfig/network and set the HOSTNAME and
       GATEWAY=172.31.1.1
    6) On initial reboot, log in as root and disable the following units:
           for unit in capi isdn mdmonitor netfs NetworkManager pcscd ypbind ; do
               systemctl disable ${unit}.service
           done
